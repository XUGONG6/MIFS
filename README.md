# MIFS: An adaptive multi-path information fusion self-supervised framework for drug discovery

Supporting Information for the paper "MIFS: An adaptive multi-path information fusion self-supervised framework for drug discovery"

MIFS IS an adaptive multi-path information fusion self-supervised framework, that learns molecular representations from large-scale unlabeled data to aid drug discovery. In MIFS, we innovatively design a dedicated molecular graph encoder, Mol-EN, which implements three pathways of information propagation: atom-to-atom, chemical bond-to-atom, and substructure-to-atom. Further, a novel adaptive pre-training strategy based on the molecular scaffolds is devised to pre-train Mol-EN on 11 million unlabeled molecules.
